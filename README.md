# SEMINDO
1) This is a regional tomographic model of the Indian Ocean 
2) The model was built using hybrid method consist of spectral element method and Nonlinear asymptotic coupling theory (NACT)
We use various dataset as described on the paper wamba et al. 2021 (JGR)
3) The starting model is a global SEMUCB-WM1 (French & Romanowich, 2015) and we perturbed the model in the Indian Ocean region, were
the new dataset (RHUM-RUM) was recorded.
4) Techincally we provide here a regional 1D model, which is the average of the 3D regional model.
  -The Average 1D model  is : reg_SEMINDO.model1D.dat
  -The 3D regional model is : reg_SEMINDO.model.A3d
5) The Model is parameterized laterally using spherical-splines and radially using b-splines.
